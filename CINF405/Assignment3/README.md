- This assignment analyzes transistor counts in CPUs, GPUs, and RAM for years between 1960 and 2019.

- The program analyzes the data in the three csv files. For each type of chip, the program gives the year to year average percentage increase in number of transistors (for where there is data).
- The program also does this for every two years (since Moore's Law is for every two years)
- Lastly, the program combines all three datasets into one and does the same analysis for where the year is shared between each type of chip (for instance, if each chip has data for the year 1980 it will do the analysis)
