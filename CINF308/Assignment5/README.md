* For this assignment, we started working with objects and classes. I built a simple class called TimeType that works as a static clock. The user is able to set the hour, minute,
and second (As seen in the test user file)
* The user can also increase or decrease the second value which can then either increase or decrease the minute and hour value.
* The time is returned in standard time format.
